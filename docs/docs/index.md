# WES_Analysis_11340_9740

## Description

Whole Exome Sequencing data analysis project for identifying genetic variants associated with stuttering in a cohort of 71 samples (11340/9740).

## Quick Links

- [Project README](../../README.md) — Full project overview, workflow, and milestones
- [Filtering Criteria](../filtering.md) — FDR, allele frequency, functional impact filtering
- [Individual Analysis](../individual_analysis.md) — Per-individual variant burden analysis
- [Quality Control](../qc.md) — QC validation workflow
- [Gene References](../../references/README.md) — Curated candidate gene lists

## Processing Pipeline

Post-variant-calling data processing uses the [post-calling-snakemake-workflow](https://github.com/Speech-Neurophysiology-Lab/post-calling-snakemake-workflow) pipeline.
