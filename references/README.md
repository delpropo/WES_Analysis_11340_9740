# Gene Selection for variant filtering

This document provides information for selecting genes that are or could be associated with stuttering. It includes sections for genes related to diseases other than stuttering, as well as specific biological pathways and systems.

## Stuttering
Genes directly associated with stuttering, identified through genetic studies and research on speech and language disorders.

## ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)
Genes associated with ADHD that may have overlapping pathways or mechanisms with stuttering.



## Tic Disorders
Genes implicated in tic disorders, which may share neurodevelopmental or genetic underpinnings with stuttering.



## Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)
Genes linked to autism that could provide insights into stuttering due to shared neurodevelopmental pathways.



## Parkinson's Disease
Genes associated with Parkinson's disease, particularly those involved in motor control and basal ganglia function.



## Basal Ganglia
Genes related to the basal ganglia, a brain region critical for motor control and implicated in stuttering.



## Intracellular Trafficking
Genes involved in intracellular trafficking, a process that has been linked to stuttering in recent studies.

# Pathways Analysis

This document describes the process for identifying additional genes related to pathways in the provided gene list. The analysis will involve the following steps:

1. **Gene List Analysis**:
   - The list of genes will be analyzed using [Reactome](https://reactome.org/) or other similar tools and resources (to be specified later).

2. **Pathway Identification**:
   - For each gene in the list, a detailed analysis will be conducted to identify related pathways.
   - The methods and tools used for this analysis will be documented in this section as they are finalized.

3. **Documentation of Results**:
   - The results of the pathway analysis will be compiled and documented for further interpretation and use.


Further updates to this document will include specific details about the tools and methodologies used for pathway analysis.
