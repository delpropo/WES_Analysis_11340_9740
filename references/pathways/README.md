# Pathways Analysis

This document describes the process for identifying additional genes related to pathways in the provided gene list. The analysis will involve the following steps:

1. **Gene List Analysis**:
   - The list of genes will be analyzed using [Reactome](https://reactome.org/) or other similar tools and resources (to be specified later).

2. **Pathway Identification**:
   - For each gene in the list, a detailed analysis will be conducted to identify related pathways.
   - The methods and tools used for this analysis will be documented in this section as they are finalized.

3. **Documentation of Results**:
   - The results of the pathway analysis will be compiled and documented for further interpretation and use.

Further updates to this document will include specific details about the tools and methodologies used for pathway analysis.
