# Gene Selection for variant filtering

This document provides information for selecting genes that are or could be associated with stuttering. It includes sections for genes related to diseases other than stuttering, as well as specific biological pathways and systems.

## Stuttering
Genes directly associated with stuttering, identified through genetic studies and research on speech and language disorders.
